## Context

![](spotify-logo.png)

Music (listening and playing) is one of my favorites pastimes and go-to therapy session to de-stress. From a very young age, I have always enjoyed diverse genres of music, which then prompted me to search for and discover new genres I may enjoy. That of course could be a hit or miss depending on what I discover. To combat the struggle of manually conducting searches for new or previously unknown genres of music, I ask the following question: **What determines a track's genre category?**. Knowing this may help me determine what makes a track enjoyable or not based on my own tastes and hopefully others who read this! To answer this, I downloaded a Spotify dataset from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks-db), which was gathered using the Spotify API, mined and saved by Kaggle user Zaheen Hamidani. This dataset contains track information and the audio features associated with their respective track, sourced from Spotify's API [documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-features):

## Data Description

-   **genre**: Song genre
-   **artist_name**: Song artist
-   **track_name**: Song name
-   **track_id**: Song unique ID
-   **popularity**: Song popularity (0-100) where higher is better
-   **acousticness**: A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.
-   **danceability**: Describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.
-   **duration_ms**: Duration of track in milliseconds
-   **energy**: Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.
-   **instrumentalness**: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. "Ooh" and "aah" sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly "vocal". The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.
-   **key**: The estimated overall key of the track. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C#/D#, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1.
-   **liveness**: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.
-   **loudness**: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.
-   **mode**: Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.
-   **speechiness**: Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.
-   **tempo**: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.
-   **time_signature**: A measurement used in music to indicate meter, written as a fraction with the bottom number indicating the kind of note used as a unit of time and the top number indicating the number of units in each measure.
-   **valence**: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).

## Packages and Data Collection

The following are the packages used throughout this project:

```{r, message=FALSE}
# libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(corrplot)

library(caret)
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# setting global theme across all viz
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

Let's read in the dataset from the working directory:

```{r}
# read in data
spotify <- read_csv("SpotifyFeatures.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
glimpse(spotify)
```

## Data Preparation

Prior to conducting EDA, there is already some preexisting knowledge regarding the variables within the dataset. Since this data was gathered using an API, it is always a good practice to check for duplicate observations (or rows) to ensure uniformity. The variables `artist_name`, `track_name`, and `track_id` will not be needed for the purpose of this project, thus the best course of action may be to remove them. Additionally, there are variables such as `genre`, `key`, `mode`, and `time_signature` that may be best treated as **multi-level** variables, meaning that each observation of the aforementioned variables have defined categories throughout the dataset. To conduct all of these data cleaning steps, I created a pipeline using the dplyr's `%>%` operator (loaded from the tidyverse package).

```{r}
# pipeline to clean, drop and reformat variables
spotify_clean <- spotify %>%
  # remove duplicate tracks
  distinct(track_id, .keep_all=TRUE) %>%
  # select relevant variables
  select(-c(artist_name, track_name, track_id)) %>%
  # convert character variables to factor
  mutate(genre = as_factor(genre),
         key = as_factor(key),
         mode = as_factor(mode),
         time_signature = as_factor(time_signature),
         # convert duration to minutes instead
         duration_min = duration_ms/60000) %>%
  select(-duration_ms)
```

Before proceeding any further, inspecting the genres within the dataset may be helpful in the case of a misleading genre being present.

```{r}
# ensure genres are properly written
levels(spotify_clean$genre)

# recode Children's Music genres as one
levels(spotify_clean$genre)[levels(spotify_clean$genre) == "Childrenâ€™s Music"] <- "Children's Music"

# verify recoding of levels
levels(spotify_clean$genre)
```

Success! We can now continue with our cleaning process.

As the final step of the cleaning process, let's check for any missing values:

```{r}
# check for missing data
colSums(is.na(spotify_clean))
```

Great news, 0 NAs were found!

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Now that our data is clean, we can conduct some EDA and determine whether any further manipulation to be made on the data as well as selecting the most appropriate features for the models.

```{r}
# number of tracks per genre
spotify_clean %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  count()

# reorder variables
spotify_clean <- spotify_clean %>%
  # remove A Capella from data
  filter(!genre %in% "A Capella") %>%
  droplevels() %>%
  select(genre, key, mode, time_signature, everything())
```

### Numerical Features

To ensure the data possesses proper center and spread, let's take a look at each possible features by genre. First let's visualize the distribution of each possible feature across all genres in the dataset:

```{r "Numerical Features", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# store numeric variable names in a vector
feature_names <- names(spotify_clean)[5:15]

# density plot of numeric features by genre
spotify_clean %>%
  select(c(genre, feature_names)) %>%
  # convert data to long format based on features
  pivot_longer(cols = feature_names) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, fill = genre)) +
  geom_density() +
  facet_wrap(~name, ncol = 3, scales = "free") +
  labs(title = "Spotify Audio Feature Density Across Genres",
       x = "", y = "density") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8, angle = 40),
        axis.text.y = element_blank())
```

Based on the density plots above, `duration_min`, `instrumentalness`, `liveness`, `loudness`, `popularity`, and `speechiness` require further normalization.

**Track Duration**

```{r "Track Duration"}
# look for outliers
spotify_clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = duration_min)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Duration (in minutes)")

# store outliers based on 4th whisker
duration_outliers <- boxplot(spotify_clean$duration_min, 
                             plot = FALSE, range = 4)$out

# remove outliers
spotify_clean <- spotify_clean %>%
  filter(!duration_min %in% duration_outliers)

spotify_clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = duration_min)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Duration(in minutes) - no outliers")
```

**Instrumentalness**

```{r "Instrumentalness"}
# find duration outliers
spotify_clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = instrumentalness)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Instrumentalness")

# determine number of genres with no instrumentalness
no_instrument <- spotify_clean %>%
  summarize(sum(instrumentalness == 0))

# look at genres with 0 instrumentalness
spotify_clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=log(instrumentalness), fill=genre)) +
  geom_density()
```

After the analysis above, the option I believe to be most useful to the model performance is to remove this feature altogether as there are quite a large number of tracks with 0 `instrumentalness` detected. I also stored the values within the data with no instruments detected and will determine later if the 57791 tracks are worth dropping to have `instrumentalness` as a predictor variable for the models. This will be determined during the [correlation](#correlation) step.

```{r}
# drop instrumentalness
spotify_clean <- spotify_clean %>%
  select(-instrumentalness)
```

**Liveness**

```{r "Liveness"}

```

**Loudness**

```{r "Loudness"}

```

**Popularity**

```{r "Popularity"}

```

**Speechiness**

```{r "Speechiness"}
# find speechiness outliers
spotify_clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = speechiness)) +
  geom_boxplot(coef = 4) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Speechiness")

# store outliers within duration_min
speechiness_outliers <- boxplot(spotify_clean$speechiness, 
                             plot = FALSE, range = 4)$out
# remove outliers
spotify_clean <- spotify_clean %>%
  filter(!speechiness %in% speechiness_outliers)

# verify outliers are removed
spotify_clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = speechiness)) +
  geom_boxplot(coef = 4) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Speechiness, less outliers")
```

### Categorical Features

```{r "Categorical Features"}
# categorical variable distribution
genre_bar <- ggplot(spotify_clean)
# key
genre_bar + geom_bar(aes(key)) 
# mode
genre_bar + geom_bar(aes(mode))
# time_signature
genre_bar + geom_bar(aes(time_signature))

```

**Key**

```{r "Key"}

```

**Mode**

```{r "Mode"}

```

**Time Signature**

```{r "Time Signature"}

```

```{r}
# drop mode and time signature (too biased/vague)
spotify_clean <- spotify_clean %>%
  select(-c(mode, time_signature))
```

#### One-Hot Encoding
