# Introduction

![](spotify-logo.png)

Music listening is one of my favorites pastimes and go-to therapy session to de-stress. From a very young age, I have always enjoyed diverse genres of music, which then prompted me to search for and discover new genres I may enjoy. That of course could be a hit or miss depending on what I discover. To combat the struggle of manually conducting searches for new or previously unknown genres of music, I ask the following question: **What determines a track's genre category?**. Knowing this may help me determine what makes a track enjoyable or not based on my own tastes and hopefully others who read this! To answer this, I downloaded a Spotify dataset from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks-db), which was gathered using the Spotify API, mined and saved by Kaggle user Zaheen Hamidani. This dataset contains track information and the audio features associated with their respective track, sourced from Spotify's API [documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-features):

-   **genre**: Song genre
-   **artist_name**: Song artist
-   **track_name**: Song name
-   **track_id**: Song unique ID
-   **popularity**: Song popularity (0-100) where higher is better
-   **acousticness**: A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.
-   **danceability**: Describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.
-   **duration_ms**: Duration of track in milliseconds
-   **energy**: Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.
-   **instrumentalness**: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. "Ooh" and "aah" sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly "vocal". The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.
-   **key**: The estimated overall key of the track. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C#/D#, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1.
-   **liveness**: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.
-   **loudness**: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.
-   **mode**: Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.
-   **speechiness**: Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.
-   **tempo**: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.
-   **time_signature**: A measurement used in music to indicate meter, written as a fraction with the bottom number indicating the kind of note used as a unit of time and the top number indicating the number of units in each measure.
-   **valence**: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).

## Packages and Data Collection

The following are the packages used throughout this project:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(corrplot)

library(caret)
```

```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(include = FALSE)
# setting global theme across all viz
theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

Let's read in the dataset from my current directory:

```{r}
# read in data
spotify <- read_csv("SpotifyFeatures.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
glimpse(spotify)
```

## Data Preparation

Prior to conducting EDA, there is already some preexisting knowledge regarding the variables within the dataset. Since this data was gathered using an API, it is always a good practice to check for duplicate observations (or rows) to ensure uniformity. The variables `artist_name`, `track_name`, and `track_id` will not be needed for the purpose of this project, thus the best course of action may be to remove them. Additionally, there are variables such as `genre`, `key`, `mode`, and `time_signature` that may be best treated as **multi-level** variables, meaning that each observation of the aforementioned variables have defined categories throughout the dataset. To conduct all of these data cleaning steps, I created a pipeline using the dplyr's `%>%` operator (loaded from the tidyverse package).

```{r}
# pipeline to clean, drop and reformat variables
spotify_clean <- spotify %>%
  # remove duplicate tracks
  distinct(track_id, .keep_all=TRUE) %>%
  # select relevant variables
  select(-c(artist_name, track_name, track_id)) %>%
  # convert character variables to factor
  mutate(genre = as_factor(genre),
         key = as_factor(key),
         mode = as_factor(mode),
         time_signature = as_factor(time_signature),
         # convert duration to minutes instead
         duration_min = duration_ms/60000) %>%
  select(-duration_ms)
```

As the final step of the cleaning process, let's check for any missing values:

```{r}
# check for missing data
colSums(is.na(spotify_clean))
```

Great news, 0 NAs were found!

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Now that our data is clean, we can conduct some EDA and determine any further improvments to be made on the data as well as selecting the most appropiate features for the feature engineering and data modeling processes.

```{r}
# create grouped genre table
filtered_genre <- spotify_clean %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(genre)) %>%
  # remove irrelevant and vague genres
  filter(!genre %in% c("Movie","Childrenâ€™s Music","Comedy","Soundtrack"))

# store filtered genres in a vector
genre_list <- as.character(filtered_genre$genre)
# drop temp table
filtered_genre <- NULL

# filter for genres in stored list
spotify_clean <- spotify_clean %>%
  filter(genre %in% genre_list) %>%
  droplevels() %>% # drop unused levels
  # reorder cat variables
  select(genre, key, mode, time_signature, everything())
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# store numeric variable names in a vector
feature_names <- names(spotify_clean)[5:15]

# density plot of numeric features by genre
spotify_clean %>%
  select(c("genre", feature_names)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = feature_names) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value)) +
  geom_density(aes(color = genre), alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~name, ncol = 3, scales = "free") +
  labs(title = "Spotify Audio Feature Density across Genres",
       x = "", y = "density") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank())

```

```{r}
# find duration outliers
spotify_clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = duration_min)) +
  geom_boxplot(coef = 4) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Duration (in minutes)")

# store outliers within duration_min
duration_outliers <- boxplot(spotify_clean$duration_min, 
                             plot = FALSE, range = 4)$out
# remove outliers
spotify_clean <- spotify_clean %>%
  filter(!duration_min %in% duration_outliers)

# verify outliers are removed
spotify_clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = duration_min)) +
  geom_boxplot(coef = 4) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Duration (in minutes), no outliers")
```

```{r}
# find speechiness outliers
spotify_clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = speechiness)) +
  geom_boxplot(coef = 4) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Speechiness")

# store outliers within duration_min
speechiness_outliers <- boxplot(spotify_clean$speechiness, 
                             plot = FALSE, range = 4)$out
# remove outliers
spotify_clean <- spotify_clean %>%
  filter(!speechiness %in% speechiness_outliers)

# verify outliers are removed
spotify_clean %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = speechiness)) +
  geom_boxplot(coef = 4) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Speechiness, less outliers")
```

```{r}
# categorical variable distribution
genre_bar <- ggplot(spotify_clean)
# key
genre_bar + geom_bar(aes(key)) 
# mode
genre_bar + geom_bar(aes(mode))
# time_signature
genre_bar + geom_bar(aes(time_signature))

```

```{r}
# drop mode and time signature (too biased/vague)
spotify_clean <- spotify_clean %>%
  select(-c(mode, time_signature))
```

```{r}

spotify_clean %>%
  select(feature_names) %>%
  scale() %>%
  cor() %>%
  corrplot(method="color", type="upper",
           tl.col = "black", tl.cex=0.9, tl.srt=45)
```

```{r}
# remove loudness (highest positive & 2nd highest negative corr)
spotify_clean$loudness <- NULL
```
